# Panel object.
#
# A panel figures out how data is positioned within a panel of a plot,
# coordinates information from scales, facets and coords.  Eventually all
# state will move out of facets and coords, and live only in panels and 
# stats, simplifying these data structures to become strategies.
#
# Information about a panel is built up progressively over time, which
# is why the initial object is empty to start with.
